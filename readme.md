Hello!

I've reached the end of the "Flexbox: Foundations" section in 
the foundations course provided by TheOdinProject. At this point, I have been tasked with an assignment to recreate a landing page for a website. TheOdinProject have supplied resourses such as suggested text fonts and layout but the rest is up to me to create. I am to use everything that I have learned up to this point. If I'm stuck, I'm advised to research using google and by looking at previous lessons but I am strictly forbidden from searching up solutions.

This is where the fun begins!
